Until the end of that turn, that unit is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge. At the end of that turn, the player whose turn it is can set up one objective marker wholly within No Man’s Land and within 1\" of that unit provided it can be set up exactly 9\" from one other objective marker and not within 6\" of any other objective marker.'
