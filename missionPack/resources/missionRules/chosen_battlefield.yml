name: 'Chosen Battlefield'
special_rule: 'In this mission, objective markers are not placed as shown on the Deployment card drawn. Instead, players roll off at the start of the Place Objective Markers step, then alternate setting up objective markers, one at a time, starting with the winner of the roll off.
\n\nOne objective marker must be placed wholly within each deployment zone, and the remaining objective markers must be played wholly within No Manâ€™s Land, as shown on the Deployment card drawn. Objective markers must be placed more than 6\" away from any battlefield edge and more than 9\" away from all other objective markers.
\n\nIf for whatever reason it is not possible to set up an objective marker as described above, it is not placed on the battlefield.
\n\nIf any rules require players to set up additional objective markers (e.g. Hidden Supplies) during the Place Objective Markers step, players set them up as described on this Mission Rule card.
\n\nIf any rules instruct players to remove one or more objective markers, do so after setting them all up.'
