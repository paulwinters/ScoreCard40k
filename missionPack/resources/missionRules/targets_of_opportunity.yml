name: 'Targets of Opportunity'
special_rule: 'In this mission, if a player is using Tactical Missions, then each time that player determines which Secondary Mission cards are active for them, if they have fewer than 3 active Secondary Mission cards, that player draws from their Secondary Mission deck until they have 3 Secondary Mission cards.\n\nIn this mission, if a player is using Fixed Missions, then in addition to the 2 Fixed Mission cards, that player will also draw cards from their Secondary Mission deck during the battle. At the end of the Select Secondary Missions step, that player should retrieve their Secondary Mission deck, remove all the Fixed Mission cards they did not select at the start of that step, then shuffle the remaining cards. Then, at the start of each of that playerâ€™s Command phases, if that player has fewer than 3 active Secondary Mission cards (including their Fixed Mission cards), they draw from their Secondary Mission deck until they have 3 Secondary Mission cards. That player has access to the New Orders Strategem, and can spend CP to use it after drawing their Secondary Mission cards if they wish (remember that Fixed Mission cards cannot be discarded for any reason).'
