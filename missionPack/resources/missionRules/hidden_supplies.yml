special_rule: 'In this mission, players must set up one additional objective marker in No Man’s Land.\n\nUnless the Chosen Battlefield mission rule is also in effect, before setting up this new objective marker, players must first move the objective marker in the centre of the battlefield 6\" directly towards one of the corners of the battlefield (if No Man’s Land touches any corners of the battlefield, you must move the objective marker towards one of those corners). Players then set up the new objective marker 6\" from the centre of the battlefield towards the diagonally opposite corner of the battlefield to the previously moved objective marker.'
